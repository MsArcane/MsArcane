Hey, I’m @MsArcane (Jess). I love creating. I make music and art. I also like programming. I’m currently learning python! Also GDscript so I can make games in Godot. ^_^

I like using ZyndAddSubFx in LMMS to make music. I also like using MuseScore 3. I'm trying to learn to Ardour6 by using Unfa's tutorials on YouTube. 🙏🏾
